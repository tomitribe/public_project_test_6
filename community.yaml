short_description:
Stream editor implemented as a series of InputStream and OutputStream filters. Like the unix sed and can manipulate an endless stream with little memory. 

long_description: 
Swizzle stream is pretty nice for finding/manipulating data in streams. It consists of two approaches:

 - Stream filters - wrap and rewrap input streams with input stream filters that can add/remove/replace data as it's read from the stream.
 - Stream lexer - variation of the above approach but with the stream details hidden exposing only 'String readToken(...)' methods to pull only desired data from a stream.

One limitation is that it does not support regular expressions. All tokens are treated as string literals which keeps the searching/scanning very fast and efficient as we only need to buffer and compare a known and fixed amount of data while reading each new byte of a stream.
